//! Various helpers to make Tnua's advanced features easier to use.

//!
//! Tnua exposes its mid-level data for user systems to allow as much flexibility and
//! customizability as it can provide. This, however, means that some of the advanced features can
//! be complex to use. This module provides helpers that allow using these features in an easier
//! although less flexible way.
